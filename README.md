# It's Dino Dash: Rex's Run!

As a Tyrannosaurus Rex, it's going to take a lot more than aliens, flying saucers, and a mysterious lake of fire to take YOU down! Right?

Play an entire game on one convenient screen! 

## Controls:

Game was recently modified from keyboard controls to mobile friendly controls. Click left side of screen to jump, right side to bite.

Simple as that! Enjoy!


Other Notes:
Tested in Chrome and IE. I wasn't getting sound in IE. The game does have sound effects! 

Tools: 
All graphics were created in GIMP, sound effects were generated using SFXR, and all code was written in JavaScript using Phaser. 

It's silly but please enjoy!
